# Description for AI player to play Connect 4 :

This is an AI player built using the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to play the classic game of Connect 4. The player is written in Python and uses a simple heuristic function to evaluate the strength of potential moves.

The minimax algorithm is a widely-used algorithm in artificial intelligence for decision-making in two-player games. It works by recursively exploring all possible moves from the current state of the game, and assigning a score to each possible outcome. The player then chooses the move that maximizes its chances of winning, assuming that the opponent will make the move that minimizes its chances of winning.

The alpha-beta pruning technique is a further optimization of the minimax algorithm that reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree. It works by pruning branches of the search tree that cannot possibly lead to a better move than the ones already explored.

The heuristic function used in this player is a simple evaluation function that assigns a score to each potential move based on the number of potential winning combinations that could be formed by placing a piece in that column. This evaluation function is used to determine the value of the leaf nodes in the search tree, which are then propagated up to determine the value of the parent nodes.

Overall, this AI player provides a challenging opponent for players of Connect 4 and demonstrates the power of artificial intelligence in playing strategic games.
